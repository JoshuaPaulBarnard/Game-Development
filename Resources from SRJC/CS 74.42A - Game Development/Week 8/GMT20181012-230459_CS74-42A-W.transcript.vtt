00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.599
Welcome back for another short session on some things you can do with your

2
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:26.430
Developing game skills and Fazer in part one today. We looked mostly at dealing with audio assets talked a little bit about how to

3
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:41.340
Get them into a usable format. We did some format comparisons. We saw that WAV files, for example, tend to be much larger than MP3 format files for exactly the same sound clips due to the compression schemes that are available to MP3.

4
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.270
Now I promised a couple other things.

5
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:56.970
Regarding user interface presentations. And I think we've all seen now at least a few examples of using the Fazer text object. And I did that in my first

6
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.040
Part of class today where I went ahead and define a variable for a score value.

7
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:18.780
created another global variable that could point to the text object and then in the Create phase I made the initial text object. I also set up the score value.

8
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:33.630
But this game add text syntax here again is using dot notation to tell the browser. I want to do something to my game instance that I saved in the variable called game that's a huge object model.

9
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.020
That phase are created for me when I made a new phase or game and it includes this ad

10
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:55.500
Property. That's basically known as the ad manager that has a whole bunch of methods associated with it. We've seen it for adding sprites and adding audio objects as part of this week's example. And then, of course, making text and text, you know, there's really

11
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.060
Arguments that we pass obviously to text.

12
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:14.670
We've got the X position. Why position can use a coordinate system text content to show

13
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.640
And object variable basically that has an in it at least two properties.

14
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.770
Style object as at least two props.

15
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:50.490
So we can build one of these get it showing on the screen. If we do it in the Create state by doing a game add text and boom. It's in the page and then if we want to change it.

16
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.800
You may find yourself getting some utility out of isolating things like scorekeeping into functions.

17
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.350
I have one function here. I could call from multiple places, there are multiple ways to score points.

18
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.250
And it basically increases the score global variable score value and then it uses the set text method.

19
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.800
And set text gives us an easy way

20
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.650
To update the text inside and it's a good practice.

21
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.180
To convert numbers to text.

22
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.190
Using to string which is a built in JavaScript function.

23
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:48.420
That was kind of getting basic text into the page right but you know that gives you. Well, we can preview it, it gives me, you know, Ariel basically a default font available to the browser in my page right here sitting there.

24
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.950
If I want to use a custom typeface.

25
00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.100
Well, first of all I need to know what resources are available to me for using custom typefaces, and I need to see the steps to execute

26
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:13.260
rendering a text object using something other than a built in font, like we did here in our font property value of aerial

27
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.890
So I'm going to duplicate this file here.

28
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.410
And I

29
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.860
Am like a live version of an example I already have in the folder now from experimenting earlier today.

30
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.810
Called custom font live so just starting off with my audio example is, it is in the middle. Leave that sitting there on the stove simmering

31
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:42.660
And I'm going to head over to Google Fonts. So this is at fonts Google com. There are other repositories. You can use besides Google Fonts, there's

32
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:52.650
Sites like Fox Squirrel and and other free web based font resources. Be careful where you get your phones don't get them from a shady place they may have viruses or malware.

33
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.470
Inside their file formats that could really corrupt or damage your computer. So try and get a font from a reputable place.

34
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.410
The nice thing about Google Fonts, is that it is a content delivery network. Basically they host the font files for you.

35
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:12.600
You can basically shop around. There's 900 fonts in here and there's little search engine search by name or phrase or different categories.

36
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.810
I went ahead and brewed up a quick search and search by display types and I found this kind of cool.

37
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:27.300
Slightly script. The font called lobster. It's actually kind of a hip type face that's used in lots of things these days. And I went ahead and I hit the little

38
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.190
Bubble with the plus sign in it and basically this little black bar. And here's like a shopping cart.

39
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:42.330
Of the custom fonts fonts that you selected. It includes right here in this gray box under the standard heading an HTML link element that will embed

40
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:55.980
Instructions to the browser to go off to their website fonts Google APIs calm and grab the style information necessary to load the whole font file into the browser. So I'm going to copy that.

41
00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.910
I'm going to go back to my file here.

42
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.300
And the very first thing I'm going to do.

43
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.870
Is load custom font.

44
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.600
Style info.

45
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.820
Using a link element.

46
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:24.990
Now loaded this lobster font half off the Google cloud. And so I'm going to keep track of these steps as I go through this. I'm going to call this

47
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.250
Guy here. Step one.

48
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:38.160
Of my custom fonts. Step one. So we'll see custom for step one load the font file basically right

49
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.300
Now the next thing I'm going to do.

50
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.270
Is I'm actually going to

51
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:54.600
Change the instructions to phase or when I make the new game and tell it specifically instead of this no value that we've used as

52
00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.630
The fourth argument all along, really, because we've had it just drawing the game right in the body on it.

53
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:10.830
It turns out to get the custom font to work. I'm actually have to put some HTML below that uses that font outside the game area. So I need to make an HTML element to hold the game area.

54
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:20.610
So instead of know here. I'm going to put a quoted phrase, I'll just call it game div will make a special HTML element below with this name so that it can find it.

55
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.840
So that's what are we calling this this custom font step to

56
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.850
For

57
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.190
ID.

58
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.890
HTML.

59
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:49.980
Two.

60
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.680
Now I will need to go down there and

61
00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.750
Add that element with an id value that's going to match what I put here my phrase game does

62
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:10.770
But before I do that, and let me spy on Google font one time really quick. I want to use the font name that I'm selecting and so in their sample here where they say specify and CSS.

63
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.270
It turns out the first value after this font family colon, the thing in quotes.

64
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:30.330
Is what is the name of the font is according to the browser. So I'm going to select that copy that not copying the single quote marks, just the phrase between the single quote marks. That's because when I create my text object. Now I want to refer to this special font.

65
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:46.410
So right talked about Ariel before. Now I'm going to further this font known as lobster. So this is custom fonts step, we have two three referred to custom font.

66
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.900
Font property.

67
00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:01.200
That's really important. So, so far, really, you might think that that would be just about enough, except that you remember

68
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:13.920
I made a change to my new face or game arguments I told it to draw the game and something called game, Dev. That's an HTML element that has that I, the game div. So I'm gonna go to under the body here.

69
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:27.120
Right, it did with the attributes. Right, right. The phrase did incited less than symbol with a space after it than ID equals and then in quotes. Usually I use double quotes when I'm ready HTML.

70
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:37.140
The phrase that I put in the Fazer argument game div and I believe it's empty. Now this empty rectangle in the body is where the game will be drawn

71
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:52.740
And let's see if that much works. And you might think already that we were done, it might be hard to tell us what that zero there. So let me put a little more information in my font guy here. Alright. The phrase score in there too.

72
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:04.950
You want to combine a chunk of text and JavaScript, you can use a plus sign. So here I'm taking literal chunk of text score in a space inside my single quotes

73
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:14.490
Addy, and under the chunk of text that has my score value in it which to start with is just going to be zero. Right, I'll do the same thing were right. Update the

74
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:31.590
Set text method here to change that. So what happens when the score starts increasing. Let's see what we got there. No, we do not have lobster. In fact, we have it looks more like times or something there. So, there is one more step. This is really

75
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:38.190
Mysterious maybe. But what's happening is we really need to have

76
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.610
A visible element on the page that has some

77
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.480
Content some text content using that font. So the browser's forced to load it otherwise.

78
00:10:52.380 --> 00:11:06.750
Fazer and the JavaScript library that Fazer uses which is called JS and I usually have a link to if you want to learn about the library engine, which is really all the graphics that phase or can do without all the game logic and game steps.

79
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:15.420
He doesn't force the browser to load the font unless the browsers drawn the font on the page somewhere else. So we need to do that.

80
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.780
So our first step was an HTML element.

81
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.300
Of paper draw the game in

82
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.850
We did that already refresh. Write a comment for it. Now, here's the secret weapon custom fonts.

83
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.760
Show some content using

84
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:55.290
Forces, the browser to load the font definition human rights P for a paragraph and I'm gonna write a space and then the word style and I'm gonna write fonts dash family.

85
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:04.260
A colon and then the font name. In this case, it was lobster. All right. The closing bracket for that opening p tag.

86
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:12.840
Was put a phrase there. Right. And so now I basically got a visible chunk of text below my game below this div.

87
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:28.560
That has a phrase, and it's showing that text. The should force the browser to load the custom form. Now you can see actually there my score text in my text object in phasers using this custom font called lobster. You can see him here. That's pretty much what he looks like. Right.

88
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:42.420
And that's because there's this element down here that is loading the font force loading the font and the browser. If you don't want text sitting below your game object or maybe you do maybe what's the message is there.

89
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:54.420
That's, that's one consideration, but if you just want it to not be visible. You could set the color and, for example, if your, if your background color of the body right now is white.

90
00:12:55.230 --> 00:13:05.490
You could set its color to white or if you want to make the whole area black, you know, you could do that too. But if I just set it to white now because it's not a white background that the person

91
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:10.500
Interacting with your game they really can't see that text down there. It is down there.

92
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:18.090
But it's not visible anymore. And in that way, we kind of shoe horn, the browser into loading our custom font.

93
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:29.460
That's how to use custom fonts kind of five steps to add to your existing code if you want to download a custom font. Again, you can find tons of custom

94
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:41.580
Fonts fonts.google.com or another good reliable when I mentioned to is fun squirrel, which has a lot of wacky fonts. Some of the most beautiful, but they have quite a huge variety of fonts here.

95
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.480
Both of these have a search engine can kind of search funds right different styles.

96
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:55.260
So that's custom fonts to enhance your user interface.

97
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:08.670
Another thing I wanted to show was how to do user interface elements that are that are graphical and Fazer gives us the ability to draw graphics into the page.

98
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:16.560
There's an example here on Facebook dot iOS examples we use the graphics object. And it's just like, you know, a sprite.

99
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.510
Or an audio object or a text object is another object we can add to our game.

100
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:30.060
And then we can draw inside of it. It's kind of like a blank canvas when you fire it up. And so here's kind of their sample code for this, we add a graphic.

101
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:44.220
With a variable referring to it again like we normally would. And then we can execute a bunch of different instructions to draw different shapes into that graphic, including setting a Phil color and notice

102
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:52.740
The Color number here after the zero x is in fact another one of those hex colors like we saw earlier today, when I was playing and pixel or calm.

103
00:14:53.160 --> 00:15:03.120
And I was showing you the W three schools reference for web hex colors. This again following that based 16 hexadecimal math, but again you can pick out a visual color out of the Color Picker.

104
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:10.710
And pixel or Photoshop or anything with a color picker, and then just copy it's hex value. Just put it after the zero x

105
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:20.340
Same with the line style. This is the thickness and pixels. This is the color and this is the opacity, so we can make things kind of semi transparent, if we want

106
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:31.620
And so using the weapon of this graphics object that we can add to our game. I'm going to draw a little life or health bar. In my case, I'll make it simple. I'll make it a

107
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.480
Little tiny countdown timer, if you will.

108
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.240
The sky graphical UI.

109
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.450
And

110
00:15:49.500 --> 00:16:02.640
Again, I'm starting with the audio example I am going to track some more variables. I'll track this value. I'll call a life value kind of how long you are alive for in this case. And I'm going to also have a

111
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:24.180
A rectangle graphics object, if you will, that visualizes that life. So just kind of like we have a score value and a variable to hold the pointer to the text object we create. I'm going to have kind of a life value and a pointer to the graphics object I make that. But I'll have a rectangular

112
00:16:48.180 --> 00:17:04.770
I'm going to create the graphic as a shape. I'm not going to load a bitmap. In other words, for my little life bar counter that kind of going to look like a little bar graph going down right but in my create code. I'm going to want to set up.

113
00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.170
I'll just do it here.

114
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.070
Right. The top to make it easy to see this.

115
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.550
I'm going to set a starting value for the life

116
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:27.060
And again I call that variable life value. So I'll just set it to 100 and now I'm going to create

117
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.560
A graphics object in the game.

118
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:37.140
And I have a variable called life.

119
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.450
And so game add

120
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:41.910
Graphics

121
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:58.140
And I don't have to say anything else when I added graphics. I don't have to give it any properties at all. If I don't want to any African excuse me any arguments inside the parentheses. I'm just making a big blank canvas, it can lay over the whole game potential is I wanted to

122
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.100
That Phil color.

123
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.500
First object. I'm really only gonna draw one for shape will say,

124
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:27.930
I'm going to refer to this new graphics object by its variable, I'ma say rectified dot and instruction here, the method calls begin fill this is where I write this weird

125
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.950
Zero x and then a hex color value.

126
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:46.110
Is not in quotation marks. This is just straight content. I'm typing in there that zero x that proceeds that value. I put there tells JavaScript that this is written as a hexadecimal number

127
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:54.480
I want to set the line stroke for this first shape.

128
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:07.080
Refer to the graphics object of the need and face or gives us this line style method, we can call it takes three arguments. Let's see.

129
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.890
first argument is buying with

130
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:18.420
In pixels. Second is hex color again using zero x

131
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:29.760
And the third is the transparency, also known as the alpha 0.0 to 1.0 1.0 is fully. Okay, great.

132
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.280
We'll play with that a little bit, maybe

133
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.800
And so let's see. I'm going to set the thickness, just a pixel

134
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:49.560
And I'll set the color using the zero x prefix to you can do upper and lowercase letters when you have them in the values will do lowercase time to kind of a yellow

135
00:19:51.420 --> 00:20:05.460
And then I'm going to make it fully opaque. So what 1.0 basically right for just one same difference. So there's my my line style with the three different arguments separated out to kind of see them a little bit better.

136
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.390
And now I'll go ahead and

137
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.990
Draw the rectangle that I want here.

138
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.080
There's a method called draw rack.

139
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.060
And just like all these other methods. There's some arguments I can send it

140
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:40.410
First argument for draw wrecked is the exposition. Second, as you might imagine, is the Y position. The third is the width and the fourth is the height. It's all and

141
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.700
Of course, like, usually. So let's see. I'm gonna plop this guy.

142
00:20:45.960 --> 00:21:00.660
At 100 x. So a little bit over on the screen 35 lie a little bit down and I'm going to make him as long as my life value is so going to start off being 100 pixels wide, and I'll make him 10 pixels thick.

143
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:09.180
So let's, let's try that much. This is all happening in the Create code. And so let's see what this little bar looks like.

144
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:24.240
She can see him there. There's my little red bar with the yellow stroke around it and it's sitting there, put it perfectly, you know, a little bit further over from the score that's sitting there and let's now animate that

145
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:30.270
And in our update loop. Let's slowly decrease the value in life value.

146
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.570
So that we end up with

147
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:45.210
A shorter and shorter and narrower and narrower rectangle. I'm going to head down to the update code. And again, just to kind of keep this example focused

148
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.230
Deal with the lifetime value.

149
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.650
And far display.

150
00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:54.660
Updating

151
00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:06.150
Let's subtract something from life value. Let's say life value equals life value minus. I'm gonna just subtract 10% one 10th. Excuse me.

152
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:12.660
Point one, if you will, in decimal numbers and then let's go ahead and draw

153
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:15.240
The rectangle again.

154
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.080
And so it's 100

155
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:25.110
X 35 why we use life value as its with

156
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.470
And we'll go to 10 for its height.

157
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:46.050
And boom, we're basically updating the rectangle with every update now changing its width and we're slowly making it narrower and narrower and I'm going to show you what this does, because you might be a little surprised by the behavior here.

158
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:56.820
Going to do it just here in the preview. You can see what's happening. The rectangle is getting shorter and shorter, but the graphics canvas. The graphics

159
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:14.880
That were drying it doesn't erase itself and redraw itself. Right, so you could see as I'm slowly growing shorter and shorter and basically smearing the yellow stroke. And now you can see I'm in a negative number. So it's actually drawing in the other direction.

160
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:24.690
So we might want to add a little conditional here in the update to decide if a person's dead yet, we could say if life value is less than or equal to zero.

161
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:35.250
Then we could we could destroy the game. We have tried to stay in the game yet. It's too little dramatic destroying the game. So I'll show you what it looks like this completely wipes the game.

162
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.950
And spacer update blue and white.

163
00:23:47.460 --> 00:24:02.850
Really what I wanted to call your attention to is this lack of a refresh really going on here. It's just redrawing the rectangle on top of the previous rectangles that were drawn there. And so that's the behavior. You should expect when you're dealing with the graphics object.

164
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:09.240
A technique to point out that you could use to work around that is if you drew a stroke.

165
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:21.930
Around the fill that was the same color as your background, you would have effectively end up with an invisible outline. Right. And so if we go back up to our

166
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:28.020
Our code here. The line style. I made it that yellow color.

167
00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.130
It's trying to get just totally black

168
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:39.810
Six euros after the x to the totally black and you might see what I mean. Now,

169
00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:50.820
You see now basically because we're on a black background, the black outline of the rectangles. Not really noticeable.

170
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.390
In the game is destroyed suddenly and dramatically.

171
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.110
So those are the tricks that I wanted to show you

172
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.510
So you can see how

173
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:44.430
You could do things other than text and how you could also do custom fonts. I did promise also a peek at some enemy artificial intelligence. I'm going to save that for another session over the weekend. It's really

174
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:54.000
Something that's beyond any of the assignment requirements. But if you're curious about it. Feel free to look at my experimental folder here, which has some working code in it.

175
00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:04.950
In my workspace. Otherwise, I look forward to seeing you online and the sharing support discussions and see what you come up with, as you think about extending your

176
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:13.530
In progress assignment from last week with some audio and some graphical user interface. Thanks for joining me for part two.

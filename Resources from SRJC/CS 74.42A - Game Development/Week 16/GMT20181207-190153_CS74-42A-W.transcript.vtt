1
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.340
Welcome. It's week 16 already and we are in game development.

2
00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.710
We are in

3
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:28.920
The final build and play tests sprints, as we head to the end of the semester and hopefully the game prototype that you are happy to have been involved with

4
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.910
This week's presentations relatively brief.

5
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:43.410
mostly focused on kind of a recap of the process that we're in and some more encouragement to jump in and share your game.

6
00:00:47.760 --> 00:01:04.500
We've got one more week of regular classes during which time we'll tackle sprint number three. Our final sprint and then during week 18 the final exam week where a final exam will be available online in Canvas. You're invited to turn in your final project at that point.

7
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.250
Here's a little detailed bird's eye view of this week, and the next two weeks.

8
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.160
Remember to share a URL.

9
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.730
For your in progress word if you're trying to figure out what URL to share. I just want to show you

10
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.710
An example from one of our classmates here is

11
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.870
A preview URL for an in progress prototype.

12
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.020
And it looks like it's going to be pretty cool.

13
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.390
Interesting stuff going on. And what I really want to call to your attention, however, is the format of the URL.

14
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.510
Because Cloud nine restricts

15
00:01:46.920 --> 00:02:06.150
Others from actually running your Apache web server to view your work in progress, you'll need to use the Live Preview URL you can find that on the Cloud nine menu bar. I'll show you real quick. In this workspace from one of our classmates.

16
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.210
So if you're working with a build system.

17
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.150
Or if you're working straight with

18
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:29.280
On compiled code. The thing to do in Cloud nine is to open up the HTML file that hosts your games code. So here's the HTML file for this build system based final game.

19
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.700
And once you have that open in front most in the editor, go to the preview menu in Cloud nine menu bar and choose Live Preview, File. Now, for whatever

20
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:48.030
Reason the user interface of Cloud nine actually opens the preview here in a tab to get the full URL, click on the little button here in this

21
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:59.430
Browser panel to pop out into a new window, the whole thing. And from there you can copy the preview URL. This is the only form of the URL that cloud nine will actually serve

22
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.960
To any visitors who don't have read write access to your workspace. So keep that in mind. And please share your URLs.

23
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.700
Great for all of us to see everybody's working progress and get inspired and to play the games that you're building and give you feedback.

24
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:30.030
And so we'll continue this pattern for the next week after this one. So this week and next week. And then when we get to week 18 the finals week. The project is due, and you'll be invited to share your final link in a

25
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.010
Project presentation discussion that will open up during finals week

26
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.140
So,

27
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.920
Small steps. Remember this a prototype doesn't have to be a finished polished complete game that can take a team and many months to really build

28
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:56.670
And remember that we're working on a development process that is an agile process known as Scrum and this idea of weekly sprints is really where we're at.

29
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.910
And so hopefully you had a chance to look at the Scrum materials last week. If you haven't yet. Check it out. It is a fabulous working methodology for teams to work together.

30
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.610
kind of define a big punch list of everything you want to do on a product backlog and then bite off.

31
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.510
Digestible portions of that to do list from product backlog dump it into a weekly Sprint Backlog

32
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:36.240
Work on it in parallel and in collaboration with your teammates and then do in sprint review some play testing where you can give some feedback to feedback into the next sprint until finally in sprint review you decide, hey, this is ready for release as a full increment.

33
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.420
So again, Product Backlog your complete to do list.

34
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:59.340
Sprint Backlog let's do list for your current focused working effort sprints in the Scrum definition range from a week to a month and length and really usually not longer than a month because we're trying to make incremental progress.

35
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:10.320
If you were working in a team, you'd have the benefit of a Daily Scrum where you could put your heads together with your teammates who are collaborating and working in parallel with you.

36
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:21.210
To try and figure out how to get around obstacles that you individually may have encountered how to keep your progress going so you can check off that Sprint Backlog list and make

37
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.700
It across the sprint. Finish line to a play testing review.

38
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:46.770
This Week in the course materials week 16 there is a quiz. This week, looking backwards at Fazer and JavaScript, it should be pretty easy for all of you to accomplish this.

39
00:05:47.310 --> 00:06:01.170
And we've got a final discussion open with an article from Gamasutra from a few years ago by a fellow named Allister doolan and it's all about building a strong, independent game development team.

40
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:10.830
There is a great opportunity here in Sonoma County and in Northern California and the greater bay area to work collaboratively.

41
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:27.000
In indie game teams. If you've got a game idea and you want to push it forward. Work with your friends solicit colleagues find students have a like mind who want to work with you and think about the different roles.

42
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.150
That each of you may take on

43
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.450
It's a great simple article. It's really quite short.

44
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:47.790
And I'm hoping everybody have a chance to read that and share your thoughts about what it might be like to work on an indie team and the discussion that runs for the next two weeks. This week and next week.

45
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:56.790
And that's all I really have to share today with you. I'm going to be lurking on canvas looking for people's

46
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.920
Links to their game prototypes. I'm going to be hoping to see some stuff coming through there and I want to thank all of you for

47
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:20.160
Making it this far, we're very close to the finish line. Keep your spirits up and keep pushing forward. Remember, it's a prototype. Keep the extra credits mantra in mind, you're trying to build a minimum viable product.

48
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.960
And I'll see you online. Thanks for joining me this week.
